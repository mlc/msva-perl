msva-perl (0.2) upstream;

  * can now be invoked with a sub-command; will run until subcommand
    completes, and then terminate with the same return code (this is
    similar to the ssh-agent technique, and enables inclusion in
    Xsession.d; see monkeysphere 0.29 package for automatic startup).
  * chooses arbitrary open port by default (can still be specified with
    MSVA_PORT environment variable)
  * minimized logging spew by default.
  * now shipping README.schema (notes about possible future MSVA
    implementations)
  * cleanup Makefile and distribution strategies.
